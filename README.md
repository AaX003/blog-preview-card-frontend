## Blog Preview Card - Multi-Theme Edition

This project was my personalized verision of the Frontend Mentor "Blog Preview Card" challenge. Instead of uploading a single card, I expanded the concept into three interactive cards--each with its own color theme, topic, and state using React. This challenge allowed me to practice UI design, component structure, theme switching, and responsive layouts. 

## ✨ Demo Preview

## 🏆 The Challenge
Users should be able to
- View the project centered on the page
- See a clean, responsive layout of a multi-card layout
- Seamlessly switch through background colors based on active-card selection

---

## 🎉 Features
- Three custom cards, each one including:
  - 🧩 A unique illustration
  - 🧩 Banner label
  - 🧩 Publication date
  - 🧩 Short description
  - 🧩 Author
  - 🧩 Reflective theme color

---

## 🫆 Interactive Card Selection
- Clicking a card sets it to the active state, which:
  - Changes the background
  - Smoothly updates the visual theme with a transition
  
 ---
 
## 📱 Fully Responsive Layout
Cards automatically rearrange using grid-template-columns and fluid sizing, and stay centralized using display: flex.

---

## 🛠️ Tools
- React (Vite)
- CSS3 (custom theme styles + fonts + responsive layout)
- Figma (designed my own vector-like style illustrations)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Mapping UI themes to data objects
- State management using useState to control active-card selection
- Customizing illustrations inspired by the challenge
- Structuring reusable card components
- Building responsive multi-card layouts
- Adding enough box-shadow around elements for a 3D-aesthetic
- Aligning visual identity based on topics
